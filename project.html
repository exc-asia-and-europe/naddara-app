    <h3>Project</h3>
    <p>Access to James Sanua's journal publications and his extensive oeuvre has hitherto been difficult. 
        Threfore, the journalistic and artistic material of the Paris-exiled egyptian nationalist has hardly 
        received the degree of scholarly attention it actually deserves. Nevertheless, during the research-work 
        for her Ph.D. dissertation "The Construction of a National-Self through the Definition of its Enemy 
        in James Sanua's Early Satirical Writings" Eliane Ursula Ettmueller was able to collect James Sanua's
        complete works and –even more importantly– the majority of the originals of his magazines. </p>
    <p>Mrs Eva Milhaud kindly gave her the permission to have Sanua's legacy digitized and to make it available
        to interested readers and researchers all over the world. However, as the newspaper-series of the period
        from August 1878 to December 1884 and of the ones published between 1908 and 1910 were not among the originals,
        Prof. Dr. Nagwa Anous made it possible for her to have the reprints scanned which were published by Dar Sader
        in Beirut in 1974.</p>
    <p>The project to produce a website of James Sanua's complete works derived from Project B1 "Gauging Cultural
        Asymmetries: Asian Satire and the Search for Identity in the Era of Colonialism and Imperialism" at the Cluster
        of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context" of Heidelberg University from which it received its major
        funding. It was realized in a collaborative endeavor with the Visual Resources Team of the Cluster's Heidelberg
        Research Architecture.</p>
    <p>Responsible in the process of the elaboration were the following:
